Road Trip -- Pooowwwwder King!

Imagine, lunges,
10 sets of 75, with a 5-10 minute break between each set. Do this for two days in a row, then one day
off, another day of lunges, another day off, then a final day of.... lunges.

Am I a
lunatic?

NO!

I am a TELEMARK SKIER possessed by powder. It is amazing
how far we will go for our art. A day
and a half to get to Smithers, where we drove 20 km on a switch backed mountain
road to get to this notable hill. After
4 runs we decided we had hit it wrong and moved on.

It was a whiteout on top with about 50 km
winds and mashed potatoes, or what a local termed 'elephant snot' at the bottom
that grabbed our skis and threatened repeated face plants.

Prince George found us in the good company of friends, a little refurbishing of
the larder, a well needed chiropractor treatment, and renewed urgency to get
out to the ski hill.

This time the
destination was Powder King Resort, about 2.5 hours north of Prince George
right on the edge of the highway at Pine Pass. Now this is a hill with character.

It wasprivately
owned, much to our surprise by the older man we saw in Workwear World uniform eating a hot beef sandwich in the bar about 4 pm, and then the next morning at about 6am on the Pisten Bully, cleaning the parking
lots.

This is a very
relaxed sort of place. The kids and the
aging ski hippies that work there all have a bit of an edge to them. If they didn't, they'd be in Whistler or Lake Louise , not living in an Atco trailer hotel on the
side of a mountain a good hour from the nearest town or amenities.

Instead they don't take themselves or their
situation too seriously, they drink beer and play pool once the lift is closed
and they take every chance they get to ski the powder. And that's
really why we ended up here.

From what
they told us, we'd missed the really good 'pow'. That's in January and February when it is
literally bottomless. We would never
have known. The first day we
skied 5 day old snow that had seen some brutal daily sun. All we could handle were the groomed runs,
those not groomed being icy, rutted crusts, that defied control by our level of
expertise. But those groomed runs were
still sweet, long and wide open.

Day two we woke
up to about a foot of fresh snow and figured we had gone to tele heaven, that's
until the quads began to burn only a third of the way down the first unmarked
run.

By the time we were into the second
run the strategically consumed T3s had kicked in and we were still skiing runs
that had seen only a few other skiers, making our own new fresh track with each
run. I hit my own personal best of 24
linked turns without stopping, bending deep into the turns to use and enjoy the
powder.

Day three,
after, no less than 14 hours sleep and at least three post skiing meals we
realized that a day off the boards was our only option. Prince
George again, some shopping, and back to the hill. More fresh snow,
ski a day, another day off, and more fresh snow again. 

This place is amazing. Spent an early evening drinking beer and
playing pool with the locals. Two 40
something ski hippies were totally into it. By 7pm they were
feeling no pain. The amazing thing was,
one of them would be starting work at midnight ,
grooming runs, the other would be first in the lift lineup the next morning, taking
the first runs down the hardest black diamonds on the hill.... I guess if we
lived here we also would have quads of steel.

We left to
search out some ice around Muncho, carrying dreams of
setting up a little shack at the hill for next winter -- a common practice it
appears from the rows of trailers and cabins covered in snow in neat little
rows by the bottom of the lift.

Imagine
a whole winter at Powder King.

Another
item for the list.

Well, I have been busy....

We decided to get OUT into the backcountry
on Saturday. My buddy says "set the
alarm for 5 a.m." I grumble as I do as I am told.

Well, I won out after all, sort of, we didn't get
out of bed till almost 6\. We were out of
the house by 7:30 ,
completing the drive to Haines Junction/Kluane in about two hours.

On the trail by 10:10 -- me recovering from a fit of laughter
at the absurdity of how (\*&$\#\*(& long it takes to get geared up for a
day of skiing.

It is a beautiful, but overcast day, and soft
snow is falling. The tops of the
mountains alternate between invisibility in the flat white of the snow and huge
blurred images of their clear day selves. These transitions are driven by the constant changes in the wind.

We started out over a wooded trail but are
soon in the wide wash of bear creek. The
creek rises gently over the course of about 5-6 miles, then starts to climb
into a couloir that scoots on past Mt.Decoeli.

.The heel lifts on the skis at this point are
on high setting and it's a good workout. If you keep on going, you come into another valley which leads to Mt. Archibald.

The way up was beautiful.

About half the way up, the twists and turns
of the creek led us to a section where patches of intensely blue ice, swept
clean of snow, glowed in the dull afternoon light. Today, however we just went a km or so up
the couloir and, despite the lure of the just a look around the next corner, ...
and maybe the next one, we turned around.

It was around 2 p.m. By then, and it being late and my knee starting to complain just a bit, we
turned around to save ourselves for tomorrows patrol day at the local
hill..

Now comes the ski down? I told you guys that I am just learning how
to tele ski, right? This was my 4th,
count 'em, day ever on tele skis and the first time in the back country with
them.

You need some background. My first two days I sum up as 50% pain and
50% something else... some of it fun. My 3rd day, I learned how to
side slip and parallel turn a bit and was overjoyed at getting somewhere near
only 25% pain and 75% fun. I was on the
upswing and feeling very confident.

Back to the story -- the snow conditions
were.... interesting. There was in inch or
two of fresh stuff, more like 3 by the time we got to the bottom, then under
that about 3 inches of wind packed snow. Underneath this semi firm layer it varied.

Everything from the ice spoken of above to
interesting light weight fluffy layers that gobbled ski poles and carving skis,
resulting in more than a few very entertaining comic pratfalls.

It didn't take long before my confidence
totally disappeared and I retreated, in fear, back to the painful snowplow
method of speed reduction. It was amazing, though, that as we got down
to what you could swear was a flat creek bed, you knew it wasn't by the
effortless speed of down creek travel.

By now the light was totally flat and it became a challenge to deal with
the invisible bumps and hollows in the route down the creek. Our trail had been totally obscured by now,
by falling snow.

The last little bit was a real treat. The ski back through the woods was fluffy
powder on snow machine tracks and with just the slightest skating action you
could travel effortlessly.

Back at the truck, we ran into a couple of
park wardens, unloading a couple of snow machines to "check them out" on the
trail we had just come down, we traded info wished each other well, jumping in
the truck for the drive home which by now was, at least for the first half,
though a blizzard.

I don't have a snappy ending to this,
except to say that we got home about 6:30
p.m. had something to eat and about 7:30 decided to take a nap
before going out for a Saturday night movie. It wasn't long before we realized that was an unrealistic expectation,
and we ended up sleeping right thru till 7 the next morning.

God, long sleeps are GOOOOD!!!

Oh, and by the way, I got my confidence
back. Sunday on patrol at the hill, I
took a couple of runs with some ski instructors and got some great tips. Eight runs later, at the end of the day, I
had upped my percentages to only 5% pain and 95% fun!

Cheers and Sauza

# I am happy when I am planning an adventure

it is only 2 weeks before we leave for Ranier. Yukon Girls On Top are planning are going to set out to climb Mt. Ranier, in Washington State

We've been planning this trip since last November, but to tell you the truth, it was only last weekend when we were having a "sleepover and gear check" that it finally sunk in that ADVENTURE was just around the corner. sitting on the floor sharpening my crampons, checking the rope, setting up the tent... NOW I am excited! ANS then a mid-week chat with a climbing ranger and I can hardly contain myself. 

Ranier is an active volcano that rises to 14,410 feet, towering over the landscape. It is the most glaciated peak in lower 48 and climbing it end of May, beginning of June will put us, essentially, back in to winter once we get to the upper mountain. 

Did I say I was excited?
